# time-series-analyze-in-python
Time series of open power system data(opsd) for germany dataset trained to perform an example of time series analysis in Python language. The data set includes daily electricity consumption, wind power production, and solar power production between 2006 and 2017. Dataset consists of 4 different independent variables called Date, Wind, Solar and Wind+Solar and 1 dependent variable called Consumption.  For the scope of this project, KNN and Multiple Linear Regression(MLR) machine learning algorithms will be applied after the dataset is pre-processed. Google Colaboratory code running environment has been used for this project. Both .ipyb and .py extensions have been extracted from environment to local computer for running this code in both local computer python environments or Google Colaboratory. Dataset has been pulled from the url connection over the internet, but the dataset file is attached to the project folder considering the error while connecting the url link.
